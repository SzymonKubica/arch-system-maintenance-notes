# Issue:

When booting with only external monitor enabled, `swaylock` crashes causing
the system to become unlocked which is dangerous

# Fix:

A different version of `swaylock-effects` was installed that does not crash so
far

# Next Steps:

Try a couple of times if this version is good. If not try to fix it or opt for
another, more secure login mechanism.
